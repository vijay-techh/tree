# Deploying to Vercel

Short steps to deploy this project to Vercel:

- **Environment**: Set `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel Project Settings (Postgres/Neon connection string).
- **Install deps**: Vercel will install dependencies from the root `package.json`.
- **Deploy**: Use the Vercel dashboard or the `vercel` CLI in the repo root.

Example `vercel` CLI flow:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

What we added for Vercel:
- `vercel.json` — routes rewrites so `/api/*` maps to serverless functions and the frontend is served from `/frontend`.
- `api/*` — serverless endpoints ported from the Express app (`/api/leads`, `/api/leads/:loanId`, `/api/next-loan-id`, `/api/validate-pincode`, `/api/login`).

Local dev tips:
- To run the original Express server locally (unchanged):

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

- To run Vercel serverless functions locally, use the Vercel CLI:

```bash
vercel dev
```
